# Marketo Landing Page Framework

This framework includes specific classes for editable elements and variables that are native only to Marketo.

## Usage

- HTML needs to be hosted within a Marketo template shell.
- CSS/JS assets need to have absolute paths, pointing to a server that can preferably handle heavy traffic.
